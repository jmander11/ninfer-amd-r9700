# HTTP serving

`build-r9700/apps/ninfer-serve` loads the registered Qwen3.8-27B R9700 artifact and exposes OpenAI- and
Anthropic-compatible HTTP endpoints over one resident NInfer Engine.

## Start the server

```bash
./build-r9700/apps/ninfer-serve models/qwen3_8_27b_r9700_candidate.ninfer \
  --host 127.0.0.1 \
  --port 8080 \
  --max-context 16384 \
  --kv-capacity 32768 \
  --max-concurrency 2 \
  --spec mtp --draft-tokens 3 \
  --lm-head-draft
```

When `--model-id` is omitted, the server advertises and accepts the loaded container's exact
`identity.model_id`. An explicit `--model-id` remains a public HTTP alias override and does not
select or alter the artifact.

Vision is disabled by default: its weights, Vision scratch phase, and frozen request-transient
buffer are not allocated, and media
requests and token-count requests fail with HTTP 400 `vision_disabled`. Add `--vision` when the
server must accept image or video input. Speculative residency is likewise frozen by
`--spec mtp|dflash` and `--draft-tokens`; omitting `--spec` loads neither backend.
`--lm-head-draft` additionally loads the optimized proposal head. Qwen3.8-27B DFlash2 is available
when `dflash/` is present and can be combined with `--vision`; the text-only companion consumes
Vision-composed target hidden features. Verify is chain `W=k+1` for `k` in `1..7`; R9700 draft-window recommendations require local end-to-end measurements.
`--adaptive-draft` picks live k in `{3..N}` (DFlash `--draft-tokens N>=5`; MTP `{3,4,5}`) after each round by locking
`argmax E[Y(k)] / T(k,C,L)` from nested hop-survival `r_i` and online least-squares round time
(shared slope, per-k intercept). An unmeasured k is probed at most once and dropped when
dominated; switching k costs 1 ms. That is a sticky policy, not a once-per-launch latch: see
[adaptive drafting](maintainer/qwen3.8-27b-model.md). Frozen `--draft-tokens 4` stays `{4}`.
A later request cannot enable a capability omitted at startup.

## OpenAI Chat Completions

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "model": "qwen3.8-27b",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "system", "content": "Answer concisely."},
      {"role": "user", "content": "What is speculative decoding?"}
    ],
    "max_tokens": 128
  }'
```

The endpoint supports:

- `system`, `developer`, `user`, `assistant`, and `tool` history;
- string content and ordered text, `image_url`, and `video_url` parts; tool messages accept a
  string or text parts only;
- `max_completion_tokens` and the legacy `max_tokens` spelling;
- `temperature`, `top_p`, `top_k`, presence/frequency penalties, and a nonnegative `seed`
  (top-p/top-k/penalties are ignored by default p-less; `--no-p-less-sampling` opts out);
- one stop string or an array of stop strings;
- non-streaming responses and server-sent event streams;
- `stream_options.include_usage`;
- function tools, tool choices, assistant tool-call history, and tool-result messages.
  Engine-owned constrained generation produces `tool_calls` only when the request includes
  current tool declarations and `tool_choice` is not `none`. Tool history alone does not
  authorize a new function. Markup on a
  tools-off request stays in `content` and ninfer-serve logs a warning.
- the top-level `reasoning_effort` field;
- the `enable_thinking` extension;
- `chat_template_kwargs.preserve_thinking` and the top-level `preserve_thinking` alias.
- the vendor `ninfer` object (`capture_context_checkpoint`).

The request `model` is informational: NInfer runs one resident model, so it serves that model
regardless of the identifier and echoes the requested value back (llama.cpp-compatible). The
advertised alias is the artifact `identity.model_id` by default, or the explicit `--model-id`
override. Reasoning is returned separately as `reasoning_content`; answer
text remains in `content`.

For structured Qwen output, registered model stop tokens are excluded from selection while reasoning
is open and after `</think>` until non-whitespace answer content begins. Tools-enabled output also
excludes them for an ambiguous `<tool_call>` prefix and until its matching `</tool_call>` is
complete; this applies independently to consecutive parallel calls. Model stop tokens become
eligible after ordinary answer content or a complete tool call. If one speculative round crosses
into a protected state before selecting a model stop token, NInfer rejects that uncommitted round
and retries with the registered model stop tokens excluded. If a round sampled with those tokens
excluded later completes a tool call, NInfer commits only through that close and lets the next
round sample with model stops eligible, so extra-accepted tokens cannot immediately open another
call.

Other request-provided stop conditions remain active, and raw-output requests do not apply this
structured-output guard.

Message roles retain their input order through schema translation. The Qwen family frontend maps
both `system` and `developer` to system-class ChatML blocks at their original positions; it does not
move later instructions to the beginning of the conversation. A leading instruction keeps the
artifact template's existing tool/reasoning-instruction composition.

Only chat-template markup encodes as control tokens. Client-supplied text (message content,
reasoning history, tool-call names and arguments, tool results, and tool definitions) is literal:
a file or tool result that spells `<|im_end|>`, `<tool_call>`, `<think>`, or a vision placeholder
encodes as ordinary text and cannot open or close a turn, a tool call, or a media slot.

At startup, NInfer resolves prompt capabilities from the exact `frontend/chat_template.jinja`
resource embedded in the loaded artifact. It does not infer them from the request's `model` field,
the artifact identity, or a target profile. A recognized effort-capable template exposes `low`,
`medium`, and `xhigh`; omitting effort uses that template's declared default. An explicit effort
not exposed by the loaded template returns HTTP 400 with code
`reasoning_effort_not_supported` before prompt preparation.

For Chat Completions, `reasoning_effort: "none"` disables thinking. `low`, `medium`, and `xhigh`
select the corresponding template effort when available. The other OpenAI protocol values
`minimal`, `high`, and `max` are parsed but rejected when the loaded template does not expose them.
`enable_thinking` controls the same new-turn thinking switch; a contradictory combination with
`reasoning_effort` returns `conflicting_template_option`.

`preserve_thinking` controls whether reasoning from closed assistant turns remains in later
prompts. It defaults to the server setting, which is off unless `--preserve-thinking` is used. If
both OpenAI spellings are present they must carry the same boolean value. Unknown non-null
`chat_template_kwargs` are rejected.

Chat Completions and Responses accept a strict vendor object:

```json
{ "ninfer": { "capture_context_checkpoint": true } }
```

Unknown keys inside `ninfer` return HTTP 400. `true` snapshots the chat’s current resume
frontier `E` on an exact-hit / decode-only request into the one-slot turn-rollback head
(the same slot automatic occupy-append already writes). A later `true` at a new `E` replaces
that pin; ladder heads stay. If a ladder or rollback head already sits at this `E`, the
request succeeds with `captured_tokens = 0` and does not fill the rollback slot. A brand-new
chat (`E == 0`) is the same quiet no-op. `true` on a server started without `--spec mtp|dflash`
or with `--no-prefix-reuse` returns HTTP 400 `context_checkpoint_unavailable` before the
request is enqueued. Anthropic Messages does not accept this object.
`POST /v1/responses/input_tokens` allows `ninfer` only when omitted or JSON `null`.

Streaming begins with an assistant-role chunk, sends separate reasoning and content deltas, then a
finish-reason chunk, an empty `choices` usage trailer, and `[DONE]`. The finish chunk and trailer
both contain the same completed usage, including when `stream_options.include_usage` is false.
Non-stream responses and each stream usage/finish chunk place the per-request stats in two
OpenAI-standard details sub-objects (no top-level duplicates, no Ollama-compat aliases):

- `usage.prompt_tokens_details` — OpenAI-standard `cached_tokens` (prompt tokens served from
  prefix reuse, no recompute) plus engine stats under the `ninfer` namespace: `reuse_source`
  (`none` / `vram_resident` / `host_ram`), `prefix_reuse_path` (`full_reset` / `append_frontier` /
  `restore_turn_checkpoint` / `restore_response_checkpoint` / `restore_context_checkpoint` /
  `restore_turn_rollback`),
  `context_checkpoint` (`restored_tokens` / `captured_tokens`), `ttft_ms`, `prefill` (`tokens`, `ms`, `tok_s`, `ms_per_token`, `tail_tok_s`,
  `tail_window_s`) and `decode` (`tokens`, `ms`, `tok_s`, `ms_per_token`). `ttft_ms` is the same value as `[req] done`
  `ttft`: HTTP prepare plus engine time to the first generated token (admission wait, Vision encode, and prefill,
  including the first-token sample). It is not `prefill.ms`. Prefill `tokens` / rates cover the computed
  (non-reused) suffix only. `tail_tok_s` is that suffix's throughput over the trailing ≤1s of prefill
  GPU time and excludes Vision encode (which has its own `vision` phase in the request log). Decode
  `tokens` are `max(0, completion_tokens - 1)`: when a first generated token exists it is sampled
  during prefill (and is in `prefill.ms` / TTFT), so `tok_s = tokens / (ms / 1000)`. Clients
  that divide `usage.completion_tokens` by `decode.ms` will overstate decode tok/s (2× on a
  two-token completion). `decode.ms` is the GPU round time after host ingress and Device Graph
  install; it does not include CPU packing or graph-profile switching. Speculative GDN fold /
  compact after a round is still in `decode.ms`. Rate and millisecond fields are rounded to three decimal places.
  `cached_tokens` is the reused prefix length for any reuse path. `reuse_source` is where that
  prefix lived (`vram_resident` vs `host_ram`). `context_checkpoint.restored_tokens` is the
  absolute staged-checkpoint head frontier this request restored (the same length as
  `cached_tokens` on `restore_context_checkpoint` / `restore_turn_rollback`). It is 0 when
  the path is not one of those two. `context_checkpoint.captured_tokens` is the absolute
  advertised ladder freeze or turn-rollback pin this request wrote, 0 if it did not freeze
  or pin.
- `usage.completion_tokens_details` — OpenAI-standard keys: `reasoning_tokens` (thinking portion,
  0 when thinking is off) and, when speculation is active, `accepted_prediction_tokens` /
  `rejected_prediction_tokens`.

When this request copied KV through a host tier, the `ninfer` namespace carries `kv_ram` with this
request's HIP D2H/H2D `save_ms` / `load_ms` and/or `kv_disk` with its `save_ms`, SSD-to-host
`load_ms`, and post-disk `h2d_ms`. Each object is omitted when the request did not copy through
that tier. Process occupancy and lifetime capture/restore/eviction/drop counters are on
[`GET /metrics`](#metrics), not on the per-request usage object.

### Multimodal request

Start the server with `--vision` before sending media:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/chat/completions \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "model": "qwen3.8-27b",
    "messages": [{
      "role": "user",
      "content": [
        {"type": "image_url", "image_url": {"url": "https://example.com/image.png"}},
        {"type": "text", "text": "Describe this image."}
      ]
    }],
    "max_tokens": 128
  }'
```

OpenAI image and video sources may be HTTP(S) URLs or base64 data URLs.

Text and media requests use one context contract. After chat-template rendering and media-token
expansion, the complete prompt is admitted only against Engine `--max-context`; there is no
separate 32K multimodal prompt ceiling. Media preprocessing retains independent resource limits
for source bytes, decoded pixels, media-item count, raw patches, and Vision tokens.
`attention_pairs` remains preparation diagnostics and is not an admission limit.

An expanded prompt beyond `--max-context` returns HTTP 400 `context_length_exceeded`, including
the prepared token count and configured context ceiling. A media preprocessing resource rejection
returns HTTP 400 `media_budget_exceeded`. HTTP 413 `request_too_large` is reserved for a raw request
body that exceeds `--max-request-mib` before JSON parsing; it is not used for model-context or media
resource errors.

## OpenAI Responses Core

NInfer implements the typed-Item and semantic-event core of the OpenAI
[Responses API](https://developers.openai.com/api/reference/resources/responses/overview). All
registered artifact identities use this same adapter and Engine route. It is intentionally not
advertised as full parity with OpenAI-hosted tools, durable cloud storage, background jobs,
Conversations, or compaction.

### Create a Response

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/responses \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "model": "qwen3.8-27b",
    "instructions": "Answer concisely.",
    "input": "What is speculative decoding?",
    "max_output_tokens": 128,
    "store": true
  }'
```

The same endpoint works with OpenAI SDKs by replacing their base URL:

```python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(base_url="http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1", api_key="local-secret")
response = client.responses.create(
    model="qwen3.8-27b",
    instructions="Answer concisely.",
    input="What is speculative decoding?",
    max_output_tokens=128,
)
print(response.output_text)  # SDK helper derived from response.output
```

`output_text` is an SDK convenience property. It is not emitted as a top-level wire field; the
wire response contains typed `output` Items.

### Create request fields

| Field | NInfer Responses Core contract |
|---|---|
| `model` | required non-empty string; informational — served by the one resident model and echoed back |
| `input` | required string or non-empty typed Item array |
| `instructions` | optional string, inserted before the reconstructed conversation for this request only |
| `previous_response_id` | optional ID of a retained local Response |
| `max_output_tokens` | integer at least `16`; default is `--default-max-tokens` |
| `stream` | boolean; `true` selects Responses SSE rather than a JSON body |
| `store` | boolean, default `true`; controls local retrieval and continuation state |
| `temperature` | finite number in `[0,2]` |
| `top_p` | finite number in `[0,1]` |
| `metadata` | at most 16 string pairs; keys at most 64 characters and values at most 512 |
| `reasoning.effort` | `none` disables thinking; `low`, `medium`, or `xhigh` selects an effort exposed by the loaded chat template; `minimal`, `high`, and `max` return `reasoning_effort_not_supported` for the registered templates |
| `chat_template_kwargs.preserve_thinking` | optional boolean controlling whether closed-turn reasoning remains in reconstructed prompts |
| `preserve_thinking` | top-level alias for the same option; conflicting values are rejected |
| `text.format` | text, JSON object, or named JSON schema; see structured output below |
| `tools` | flat Responses function definitions; see below |
| `tool_choice` | `auto`, `none`, `required`, or `{"type":"function","name":"..."}` |
| `parallel_tool_calls` | omitted or `true` |
| `truncation` | omitted or `disabled`; overlong input fails instead of silently dropping Items |
| `top_logprobs` | omitted or `0` |
| `service_tier` | omitted, `auto`, or `default`; the response reports `default` |
| `background` | omitted or `false` |
| `include` | omitted or an empty array |
| `stream_options` | omitted or `{"include_obfuscation":false}` |

Unknown top-level fields fail with `unknown_parameter`. Recognized but unsupported features fail
with a field-specific 400 error instead of being silently ignored.

### Input Item contract

String `input` is normalized to one user `message` with an `input_text` part. Array input accepts:

| Item | Supported form |
|---|---|
| `message` | roles `user`, `assistant`, `system`, and `developer`; string content or typed content array |
| `input_text` | message content part containing string `text` |
| `output_text` | assistant-message replay part containing string `text` |
| `input_image` | user-message part with HTTP(S) or data-URI `image_url`; detail omitted or `auto`; requires server `--vision` |
| `input_video` | NInfer extension with HTTP(S) or data-URI `video_url`; requires server `--vision` |
| `reasoning` | raw replay Item with an empty `summary` and `reasoning_text` content parts |
| `function_call` | completed assistant call with optional `id`, and required `call_id`, `name`, and JSON-object string `arguments` |
| `function_call_output` | completed tool result with required `call_id` and string `output` |

Adjacent function-call Items are grouped into one assistant history turn. A reasoning Item attaches
to the following assistant message or function call. Input Item IDs are preserved when supplied and
generated otherwise; duplicate IDs fail.

System and developer message Items retain their positions in the input array. Top-level
`instructions` is represented as a leading developer turn for the current request; target-specific
role lowering occurs only in the Qwen family frontend.

`input_file`, `input_audio`, image `file_id`, non-`auto` image detail, reasoning summaries or
encrypted reasoning, message `phase`, and other Item/content types are not supported. HTTP media
URLs stored in a response chain are fetched again when that chain is continued; use data URIs when
the historical media bytes must be immutable.

### Function tools

Responses function definitions are flat rather than Chat Completions' nested `function` object:

```json
{
  "type": "function",
  "name": "get_weather",
  "description": "Get current weather",
  "parameters": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {"city": {"type": "string"}},
    "required": ["city"]
  },
  "strict": false
}
```

NInfer renders these definitions in the Qwen prompt. The Engine constrains Qwen tool envelopes
and supported argument schemas during ordinary and speculative target sampling, validates
completed calls, and returns typed values for separate `function_call` output Items. This runs
only when the request includes current tools and `tool_choice` is not `none`. If the model emits Qwen
`<tool_call>` markup on a tools-off request, NInfer leaves it in the answer text and logs a
warning; it does not invent a structured tool call. Each completed output has a protocol Item `id`
(`fc_...`) and a distinct `call_id` (`call_...`). The client executes the function and sends a
`function_call_output` Item in a later request. NInfer does not execute functions. Its schema
subset supports scalar/container types, properties/required/additionalProperties, array bounds,
numeric bounds, string patterns/length bounds, enums/constants, local references, and supported
`anyOf` forms. Keywords the grammar cannot enforce are relaxed so the grammar accepts a superset
of the schema's instances, and the client remains the validator for them: `format` and the
`content*` keywords are annotations; `oneOf` is constrained as `anyOf`; a single-branch `allOf`
with annotation-only siblings is inlined; and the narrowing-only assertions `not`,
`propertyNames`, `uniqueItems`, `multipleOf`, `contains`/`minContains`/`maxContains`,
`dependentRequired`/`dependentSchemas`, `if`/`then`/`else`, and
`unevaluatedProperties`/`unevaluatedItems` are not enforced. The prompt still shows the model the
original schema. A string `pattern` combined with `minLength` or `maxLength` is not
supported: the compiler would otherwise ignore the length bound. Other unsupported assertions
(for example `patternProperties` or a multi-branch `allOf`) or assertion combinations are
rejected during preparation, with HTTP 400, `code: invalid_tool_schema`, and
`param: tools` on the OpenAI error surface. Malformed schemas, patterns and unresolved
references use the same classification and retain the compiler diagnostic.
This is not full JSON Schema or OpenAI strict-tool parity:
`strict:true`, hosted tools, MCP tools, and custom free-form tools are rejected.

`tool_choice:"required"` requires at least one declared function call. A named
Responses choice uses the flat object `{"type":"function","name":"weather"}`
and restricts calls to that declared function. Both modes require current tools;
unknown names are rejected. The shared token grammar enforces a call as the first
non-whitespace content after optional thinking, with schema-valid arguments; filtering
tool declarations alone is not the enforcement. Subsequent prose and calls remain
allowed, and the normal function-call SSE events and completed Items are unchanged.
Chat Completions and Anthropic required/named choices use the same enforcement.
Output limits or cancellation can still interrupt a call and produce an incomplete
response; a required choice does not manufacture a completed call.

Qwen argument framing uses exactly one LF before and after each parameter value.
Declared arguments may appear in any order, independently of the order of
`properties` in the supplied schema or its HTTP JSON normalization. The grammar
tracks which named keys have been emitted: it cannot close before the required
keys are present, repeat a named key, or bypass a named value's constraints through
`additionalProperties`. Property-count bounds still apply. Nested schema-defined
JSON objects use the same order-independent rules, including through local
references and supported alternatives. Completed-call validation rejects duplicate
keys (including in nested JSON values); arbitrary additional key names are checked
for duplication during this final validation, not by the finite named-key grammar.
In nested JSON, an escaped alias of a declared key can also pass the library's
additional-key grammar; final validation decodes the key before checking its
value and uniqueness, and never publishes a call that fails those checks.
These rules apply on ordinary and every speculative target position, with grammar
state committed only for published tokens. They do not shorten reasoning, force an
end-of-turn after a call, or change sampling/recovery settings.
Only those framing bytes are removed; indentation, trailing newlines and literal
XML-looking text inside a string are preserved. For schemas admitting both a raw
string and a JSON value, the lossless raw-string interpretation is preferred when
the complete argument object satisfies the schema.

With declared tools, the free-text region after reasoning reserves the protocol prefixes
`</invoke`, `</parameter`, `</function`, `</tool_call`, `<invoke`, `<parameter`, and
`<function`. The prefix `<tool_call` must continue into a canonical declared call.
These prefixes cannot be sampled as orphan prose before, between, or after calls;
omitting `>` or appending whitespace/`= null` does not evade the constraint.
Legitimate Qwen call frames and these literal strings inside schema-valid tool arguments
remain allowed. The restriction
is part of the grammar domain on ordinary and speculative target positions, not a
post-response text scrubber or a recovery retry. While reasoning is open, `<tool_call`
is also excluded: a real call must follow `</think>` rather than being rehearsed inside
reasoning. Natural-language reasoning, XML tags outside these reserved prefixes,
inter-call prose, and tools-off/raw output remain
allowed. The engine never promotes reasoning markup into executable calls. Literal discussion of these reserved delimiters in
tool-enabled answer prose must use an escaped representation rather than the exact strings.
Likewise, literal discussion of the tool opener inside reasoning must escape that opener.

For default p-less sampling, Engine can withhold an unproductive repeated call and
retry internally before publishing it. The detector requires two consecutive previous
single-call rounds with the same parsed arguments, unchanged associated text results,
and an identical 64-word reasoning passage; the new proposal must repeat the call and
reasoning as well. Different results, changed arguments, an intervening user turn,
media, or ordinary short polling do not meet that evidence. This conservative detector
does not recognize every multi-tool cycle or infer arbitrary external state changes.

Recovery keeps the cached prompt, including real conversation content/results and
historical reasoning. It closes the open think turn and appends feedback explicitly stating
that the rejected proposal was not executed; only the failed generation is omitted. A later
retry appends another notice after the first. A ready checkpoint at the prompt frontier is
restored and only the appended suffix is prefilled; when no resident, RAM, or disk
checkpoint matches, the spliced prompt is prefilled from an empty KV image. It permits at most two retries within the original completion
token budget and resource reservation. It neither executes tools nor forces EOS. Already
streamed reasoning/prose remains visible; rejected calls are never published. A novel valid
call is not a guarantee that the model has made useful progress.

Text-only p-less thinking requests can also retry persistent generated reasoning before
a tool call exists. Three non-overlapping occurrences of an identical 256-token reasoning
passage must appear within the current generated attempt. Their separation may differ;
this catches multi-paragraph loops whose periods change after a one-token intervention.
In addition, repeated passages must cover at least 4,096 distinct redundant tokens;
overlapping windows cannot count the same tokens twice. This conservative threshold
allows shorter loops to escape naturally without a recovery retry.
It does not cap reasoning at 4,096 tokens.
Hashes only locate candidates; exact generated-token comparison proves the match. Prompt
tokens and previous attempts cannot supply occurrences. Two copies alone do not trigger
a retry. It is not a reasoning-length
timeout. The retry keeps the cached prompt, including historical reasoning, the original
task, and completed tool results. It closes the open think turn and appends an explicitly
labeled engine system notice; the failed attempt's generated tokens are not part of the
retry prompt, and a later retry keeps the earlier notice. Only the appended suffix is
prefilled after a checkpoint restore. It creates no assistant tool call, tool result, or
user message. Already streamed reasoning remains visible, separated from
the retry by a blank line, and charged to
completion usage. Both recovery causes share the same maximum of two retries. Requests
with media, raw output, disabled thinking, or non-p-less sampling do not use reasoning retries.
Temperature-zero generation does not trigger the reasoning detector.

Explicit caller string/token stops and cancellation terminate without a recovery retry.
A natural model end-of-turn can still expose a confirmed duplicate call and trigger recovery.

If a confirmed repeat cannot be recovered within those bounds, the request fails with
`generation_recovery_exhausted` (`server_error`, HTTP 500 before streaming headers, or
the protocol's stream error after headers). The engine remains available. When recovery
occurs, vendor usage at `prompt_tokens_details.ninfer.recovery` reports attempts,
discarded calls, `discarded_reasoning_tokens` (omitted internally, not retracted), additional
prefill tokens/samples, and preparation/prefill milliseconds.
Completion usage includes tokens spent on discarded attempts; original prompt usage is
unchanged. Raw output does not use internal recovery.

For an unintervened diagnostic baseline, launch with `--no-generation-recovery`.
This startup-only option disables both repetition-driven token exclusions and internal
reasoning/duplicate-tool retries for every request. It leaves tool grammar, p-less sampling
at all speculative target positions, and ordinary stopping/cancellation/budgets unchanged.
Omit the flag to restore the default enabled policy. Disabled recovery can allow a loop
to consume the entire output budget; it is not recommended as a general cure for loops.
The startup log explicitly records when recovery is disabled.

Wire captures remain accurate with recovery enabled, but streamed reasoning can contain
multiple attempts. Correlate them with the server's request-scoped recovery logs. A missing
`prompt_tokens_details.ninfer.recovery` object does not establish zero cycle exclusions:
that object reports discarded-generation retries, whereas cycle exclusions are logged.

The server emits live `[req N] recovery` console records for streaming and non-streaming
requests on all three HTTP surfaces. `retry_triggered` identifies `repeated_reasoning` or
`duplicate_tool_call`; `retry_started` marks the retry prefill, and
`retry_prefill_complete` marks its completion. `exhausted` is a warning before the request
error. `finished` reports the terminal outcome (including cancellation or output limits),
not a claim that the task succeeded. Records include started attempt count,
cumulative discarded reasoning/tool counts, generated tokens and remaining output budget.
`cycle_exclusion` means one root-token exclusion was armed for sampling, not that a retry
occurred or that it changed the counterfactual draw. To bound traffic these records appear
at counts 1, 2, 4, 8, ...; terminal recovery records include the exact cumulative count.
These diagnostics contain no prompt, reasoning, tool arguments, or token text, and never
enter HTTP model-output chunks. Tool grammar is continuously enforced rather than a
recovery trigger; its normal operation does not emit recovery events.

### Response object and usage

A terminal wire response has `object: "response"`, one of `completed`, `incomplete`, or
`cancelled` in `status`, and a typed `output` array. NInfer may emit:

- a `reasoning` Item containing raw `reasoning_text` and an empty summary;
- an assistant `message` containing an `output_text` part;
- one or more `function_call` Items.

Ordinary model/string stops produce `completed`. Output-token or context-capacity exhaustion
produces `incomplete` with `incomplete_details.reason: "max_output_tokens"`. Errors accepted after
an SSE response has started produce `response.failed`; validation and preparation errors remain
normal HTTP error responses.

Usage is checkpoint-native:

```json
{
  "input_tokens": 42,
  "input_tokens_details": {"cached_tokens": 17},
  "output_tokens": 12,
  "output_tokens_details": {"reasoning_tokens": 5},
  "total_tokens": 54
}
```

`input_tokens` includes the chat template and expanded media tokens. `cached_tokens` is the exact
resident prompt prefix reused by Engine. `output_tokens` is the count of accepted generated token
IDs, including a withheld stop token when applicable. `reasoning_tokens` is counted in the Qwen
output decoder while accepted tokens are still in the reasoning channel; it is not estimated by
re-tokenizing decoded text.

### Responses streaming

Set `stream:true` for semantic Server-Sent Events. Every frame uses both the SSE event name and a
matching JSON `type`, and every JSON event has a monotonically increasing `sequence_number`:

```text
event: response.output_text.delta
data: {"type":"response.output_text.delta","sequence_number":7,...}

```

The normal lifecycle is:

1. `response.created`, then `response.in_progress`;
2. `response.output_item.added` and `response.content_part.added`;
3. zero or more `response.reasoning_text.delta` or `response.output_text.delta` events;
4. matching `*.done`, `response.content_part.done`, and `response.output_item.done` events;
5. exactly one `response.completed`, `response.incomplete`, or `response.failed` terminal event.

Function arguments use `response.function_call_arguments.delta` and `.done`. IDs, output indices,
and content indices remain stable, and concatenated deltas equal the terminal Item. Responses SSE
does not emit the Chat Completions `[DONE]` sentinel. With tools enabled, ordinary answer text still
streams immediately; only an ambiguous `<tool_call>` suffix or the structured tool region is held.
An interrupted declared-tool envelope (caller stop, cancellation, or output budget) is not
published as a call or flushed into prose. Already completed calls are kept separate from text.
Long reasoning is not by itself a loop or a reason to truncate output.

### Local response state and resources

`store` defaults to `true`. Stored Responses are bounded by an LRU store. By default
it is process-local. Set `--response-store-location DIR` to retain terminal objects,
normalized input Items, thinking policy and the shared conversation DAG across restarts.
The directory is exclusively owned by one server process. This is local protocol-history
persistence, not numerical checkpoint storage or OpenAI's cloud retention service.

Persistent mutations and LRU access order are committed through an atomic, synced manifest;
immutable context nodes are shared between branches. A successful stored terminal response or
delete is durable before its HTTP success is published. Streaming deltas alone do not create
a stored entry. A disconnect after the terminal object has been stored can leave a retrievable
ID even if the client did not receive its final SSE event. Unpublished payloads and unreachable
ancestors are reclaimed after a commit or on startup. I/O publication failure returns an
error and disables store access until restart rather than serving divergent memory/disk state.
A missing or malformed committed payload fails startup rather than silently dropping history.

The existing record and memory-accounting limits apply after restart; lowering them evicts
least-recently used public IDs on startup. They are not exact filesystem-byte quotas: JSON
serialization and transient old/new payloads need additional disk space. The directory contains
conversation and media source data in plaintext; use a dedicated location with appropriate local
permissions. Owned media bytes are retained; external media URLs/paths are reacquired when a
continuation is prepared, as with the process-local store.

`previous_response_id` reconstructs the complete stored input/output Item history before the new
input. The current `instructions` value is placed first but is not saved into the continuation
context, matching the Responses rule that previous top-level instructions do not carry forward.
Function definitions are request configuration rather than conversation Items and must be sent
again on tool-result turns. The reconstructed prompt follows the ordinary Engine path, so resident
prefix reuse applies naturally. After restart the model can recompute this history or use an
independently valid existing prefix cache. This store does not serialize GPU KV, GDN or DFlash
state and makes no fast numerical-resume promise.

A stored Response also retains its resolved `preserve_thinking` value. A child which omits the
field inherits the parent value. An explicit different value creates a new semantic branch; prompt
rendering and identity still determine reuse. Changing the boolean alone never invalidates an exact
current frontier or a complete matching rewrite checkpoint.

Resource behavior:

| Endpoint | Contract |
|---|---|
| `GET /v1/responses/{id}` | returns the stored terminal object, or 404 `response_not_found` |
| `DELETE /v1/responses/{id}` | removes public retrieval and returns `response.deleted`; descendant contexts already retained by other Responses remain usable |
| `GET /v1/responses/{id}/input_items` | returns normalized Items supplied to that request; supports `after`, `limit` `1..100` (default `20`), and `order` `asc|desc` (default `desc`) |
| `POST /v1/responses/{id}/cancel` | explicitly fails because background execution is unsupported |
| `POST /v1/responses/compact` | explicitly fails with `compaction_not_supported` |

`store:false` Responses cannot be retrieved or used as `previous_response_id`. LRU eviction and
explicit deletion also make an ID unavailable. A single Response larger than the configured store
capacity fails with `response_store_capacity_exceeded` rather than silently pretending it was
stored.

### Candidate continuation scoring

`POST /v1/score` is a local, non-streaming scoring API:

```json
{"model":"qwen3.8-27b","messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Name a primary color."}],"candidates":["red","blue"]}
```

It accepts `model`, `messages`, 1–16 nonempty string `candidates`, and the existing
`enable_thinking`, `preserve_thinking`, `reasoning_effort` and `chat_template_kwargs`
controls. Context may include text and tool history; media, active tool declarations,
sampling controls, output formats and generation options are rejected. The model field
is informational, as on other endpoints. Each candidate is appended as the final assistant
message to the same history; candidates never see one another.

Scores use the qualified teacher-forced prefill path and exactly the final-assistant boundary
used by `ninfer-ppl --score-last-message`. The scored suffix includes template-generated
reasoning framing, if any, and the assistant turn closure. Thus these are probabilities of
**rendered assistant continuations**, not just bare strings. The response has
`object:"candidate_scores"`, `scoring:"rendered_assistant"`, `schedule:"prefill"`, and a `data`
array in input order. Each entry contains `index`, `text`, `prompt_tokens`, `scored_tokens`,
`sum_nll`, `mean_nll`, `log_probability` (negative sum NLL), and `score_seconds`.
`mean_nll` divides by `scored_tokens`; both quantities are exposed because candidates of
different lengths can rank differently by sum and mean. No calibrated confidence or
closed-set normalization is claimed. `usage` sums prompt and scored tokens across entries.
Nonfinite or empty scores fail the entire request instead of producing a partial ranking.

Scoring requires an idle Engine and returns HTTP429 when it is busy. One execution reservation
covers all candidates; normal generation cannot interleave with scoring resets. Requests
arriving afterward may queue normally. Each prepared sequence must fit `--max-context`, and
the aggregate token count must not exceed four times that limit. A client disconnect is checked
between candidates; it does not interrupt a running prefill chunk. This API reuses existing
scoring arithmetic, not computed shared-prefix state, and does not claim a branch-scoring speedup.

### Responses input token count

`POST /v1/responses/input_tokens` accepts exactly `model` and `input`, performs the same typed Item,
template, and media expansion, and does not run generation:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/responses/input_tokens \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"model":"qwen3.8-27b","input":"Count this prompt."}'
```

```json
{"object":"response.input_tokens","input_tokens":11}
```

Unsupported Create fields include Conversations, prompt templates, context management, hosted
moderation, prompt-cache controls, safety/user identifiers,
non-empty `include`, background execution, compaction, files/audio, and OpenAI-hosted/MCP/custom
tools. These are compatibility boundaries, not silently accepted placeholders.

## Structured JSON output

Chat Completions accepts `response_format:{"type":"json_object"}` or
`response_format:{"type":"json_schema","json_schema":{"name":"result","schema":{...},"strict":true}}`.
Responses accepts the equivalent `text.format`, with `name`, `schema`, optional `description`
and optional `strict` directly alongside `type:"json_schema"`. Omitted/null formats and
`{"type":"text"}` retain normal text output. Schema names use 1–64 letters, digits, underscores
or hyphens. Responses echoes the requested format in created and terminal objects.

JSON object mode enforces an object; schema mode enforces the supported schema on one JSON value.
The same schema subset and unsupported-assertion checks described for tools apply. `strict` is
accepted as a boolean/null; supported assertions are enforced regardless of its value. Unsupported
schemas fail with HTTP400 `invalid_output_schema`, rather than being silently weakened. Format
shape/combination errors use `invalid_output_format`. The error parameter is `response_format`
for Chat or `text.format` for Responses.

Optional reasoning remains a separate unconstrained channel before the JSON content. Ordinary,
MTP and DFlash sampling use the same grammar preview/commit and tree-mask machinery; JSON does
not force target-only decoding. Active tools and custom stops cannot be combined with JSON output;
tool history remains valid input. Literal tool markup inside JSON strings remains data.
Content streams incrementally and may be incomplete on output/context limits or cancellation;
only normal model-stop completion guarantees the completed constrained value. No tools execute.
The public Engine uses `PromptOptions.output_json_schema` and requires its default model stops
and parsed output for this mode.

The real-engine smoke client is `python3.11 -m tools.smoke.serve_features --model MODEL
--base-url BASE --concurrency 1` (use concurrency4 for a C4 server). Run it against each
qualified ordinary/MTP/DFlash configuration under the shared GPU lease. `--save-response FILE`
and, after restarting with the same store directory, `--restore-response FILE` exercise durable
retrieval and descendant continuation. The client does not start or stop servers.

## Anthropic Messages

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/messages \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "model": "qwen3.8-27b",
    "max_tokens": 128,
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Explain prefix reuse in one sentence."}
    ]
  }'
```

The endpoint supports top-level system text, ordered mid-conversation system messages,
user/assistant history, text and image blocks, thinking blocks, tool-use history, tool results,
client-defined tools, non-streaming responses, and Anthropic SSE events.
Mid-conversation system messages remain at their `messages` array position and are not merged into
the top-level system instruction. A system section must follow a user/tool-result message and be
final or immediately precede an assistant message; it cannot interrupt a tool-use/tool-result pair.
Consecutive system messages remain separate ordered turns.

`thinking.type: "disabled"` disables thinking; other supported values enable it. Returned thinking
blocks carry the message id as a non-empty opaque `signature` (a `signature_delta` just before the
block's `content_block_stop` when streaming); echoed thinking text is lowered directly into history
and the signature is not validated.
The independent top-level `preserve_thinking` boolean controls closed-turn history and otherwise
uses the server default.

Anthropic `output_config.effort` accepts the protocol values `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, and
`max`. The value is then checked against the loaded chat template in the same way as the OpenAI
endpoints; the registered effort-capable template exposes `low`, `medium`, and `xhigh`. Combining
an effort with `thinking.type: "disabled"` is rejected as contradictory.

Anthropic's `model` field is treated as a response label and does not select the loaded artifact.

`POST /v1/messages/count_tokens` uses the artifact's tokenizer, chat template, and media expansion
without running GPU generation:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/messages/count_tokens \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "model": "qwen3.8-27b",
    "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "Count this prompt."}]
  }'
```

## Authentication and CORS

Pass `--api-key VALUE` to require the same value as an OpenAI bearer token or Anthropic
`x-api-key` header. `GET /health`, `GET /metrics`, `GET /metrics.json`, and CORS preflight
requests remain unauthenticated. Binding a non-loopback `--host` therefore exposes occupancy, queue
depth, and token totals to anyone who can reach the port.

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1/models \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer local-secret'
```

`--cors` adds permissive browser CORS headers. It is disabled by default.

| `--prefill-chunk N` | text-prefill chunk | `2048` |
| `--mixed-forward auto\|N` | forward width (columns) of each prefill step while other requests are decoding; `0` runs each prompt's whole prefill first. With DFlash a text prompt's slice rides inside a decode round: one forward of `N` columns holds the verify columns of the decoding requests and the prompt tokens fill the rest, at least `N - (C-1)*W`. Other prompts run a separate step of `N` tokens. `N` must be a multiple of 256 (prefill loses 3–5% between multiples), at most `--prefill-chunk` and `--max-context`, and wider than `(C-1)*W`. `auto` is 1024 (bounded by those, rounded down to a multiple of 256) under DFlash with C > 1 and `0` otherwise; startup logs the resolved value. Smaller widths shorten each decode pause (about 0.18 s at 512 against 0.30 s at 1024) at some prefill throughput. See [prefill/decode frontier](performance.md#mixed-prefilldecode-frontier-2026-09-29) | `auto` |
| `--mixed-forward-rounds N` | decode rounds per prefill slice (`1` = every decode round carries one slice; larger values leave plain decode rounds between slices) | `1` |

| `--dflash-verify-width N` | DFlash2 chain verify width `W=k+1`, `2..8` | auto |
| `--dflash-p-less-draft-temperature T` | DFlash2 draft temperature `0..2` for p-less requests: drafts are drawn from the 16-candidate path-select softmax at `T` and verified against that proposal, so output stays exactly the p-less target distribution. `0` drafts greedily. At p-less `T=1.5` on the R9700 (K7 adaptive, 6 prompts x 2 seeds), `0.4` gave +9.9% decode over greedy drafts (acceptance 3.32 -> 3.56 tok/round) | 0.4 |

| `--greedy` | force exact argmax for all requests | off |
| `--no-p-less-sampling` | opt out of p-less and use top-p/top-k/min-p/penalties | p-less on |

The configured `--draft-tokens` value is fixed for the server lifetime. Startup creates only the
matching speculative Device Graph profiles; requests cannot select a different live K. An
automatic K policy requires fresh same-candidate execution-parity, acceptance, and complete-round timing evidence on
the selected R9700 artifact at each supported concurrency before it can become a product option.

Engine selects sampling defaults from the loaded model and the request's resolved thinking mode.
Qwen3.8-27B uses temperature `2.0` and presence penalty `0` in both modes
(`2.0/0.95/20/0/0` thinking, `2.0/0.80/20/0/0` non-thinking).
Frequency penalty is `0` for all registered presets. Process flags override
registered values, request fields override process flags, and `--greedy` finally forces
temperature `0`. P-less is enabled by default; it keeps temperature and seed and ignores top-p,
top-k, min-p, and presence/frequency penalties from both process flags and request bodies. Startup
logs a one-time warning. Ignored request fields must still satisfy their normal input ranges before
sampler resolution.
`--no-p-less-sampling` opts into the registered production sampler. Combined with `--greedy`,
p-less remains exact argmax. P-less membership is `p_v ≥ max(L·exp(-2ε/T), 1/M)` with
`ε = 1/16` and `M = 1024`; L is the unperturbed collision probability, and an empty set
falls back to the eligible mode. Under MTP or DFlash2, p-less applies at every hop (block verification over
the chain with the recorded draft `q`; DFlash2 drafts are sampled at `--dflash-p-less-draft-temperature`)
and to the bonus. A thinking-cycle exclusion affects only the next token,
not later hops in the same speculative round. There is
no OpenAI or Anthropic schema field for this mode.

Run `./build-r9700/apps/ninfer-serve --help` for the exact option contract.

## Metrics

`GET /metrics` is Prometheus text exposition 0.0.4 (`text/plain; version=0.0.4`).
`GET /metrics.json` renders the same snapshot as JSON: counter totals and histogram `count` / `sum`,
not rates. Both read the public Engine `RuntimeStats` once per scrape plus the serve-owned
counters; a scrape never queries the HIP device. Device-memory families are the startup
measurements.

```bash
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8080/metrics | head
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8080/metrics.json | jq .scheduler,.gpu_kv,.kv_ram,.speculative,.recovery,.phases

`ninfer_generation_phase_seconds{phase}` has the closed phases `prepare_cpu`, `media_wait`,
`media_fetch`, `queue`, `copy_hold`, `vision`, `prefill`, `decode`, `recovery`, and `http_tail`
(definitions under `request_done.timings_seconds` below); only positive phases are observed. Phase
samples need not sum to end-to-end: recovery re-prefill, HIP copy time, and copy-hold wall overlap.
`ninfer_generation_inter_token_latency_seconds` is decode seconds per decode-evaluated output token
(TPOT); `ninfer_generation_output_tokens_per_second` is its inverse and matches NInfer tok/s
reports. Latency, token, finish-reason, prefix, and speculative families observe successful
generations only; `ninfer_generation_requests_total` also counts `rejected`, `error`, and `cancelled`
attempts. `ninfer_recovery_events_total{kind="cycle_exclusion"}` counts published events, which are
powers-of-two samples; the true exclusion count is `ninfer_recovery_cycle_exclusions_total`.
Exhausted-recovery details collapse into the closed causes `retry_budget`, `output_budget`,
`lane_rebuild`, `prologue`, and `other`; the JSONL `recovery` event keeps the raw text.

```

## Structured request log

`--request-log-jsonl FILE` enables the machine-readable measurement log. The server opens `FILE`
in append mode and flushes every event, so successive model or MTP blocks may share one campaign
file. The parent directory must already exist. Failure to open the file aborts startup; the log path
is also rejected if it resolves to the model artifact.

```bash
./build-r9700/apps/ninfer-serve models/qwen3_8_27b_r9700_candidate.ninfer \
  --request-log-jsonl profiles/bench/run/server.requests.jsonl

Every line is one `ninfer_serve_request_log` schema-v22 JSON object. All events carry
`timestamp_unix_ms` and a process-unique `server_instance_id`; request IDs are monotonic only within
that server instance.

`server_start.engine.xattention_qualification` is always present. It is `false` in the ordinary
product build. The OFF-by-default qualification build reports `true` plus the exact
`xattention_profile`, `xattention_find_block`, `xattention_stride`, and
`xattention_tau_permille` compiled into that executable; these are evidence fields, not runtime
selectors. `server_start.engine.kv_value_group` likewise records the compile-bound G16/G32 Text
and MTP value-cache group; it is not a runtime cache selector.

`request_done.timings_seconds` contains `prepare`, `prepare_cpu`, `media_wait`, `media_fetch`,
`queued`, `copy_hold`, `ttft`, `vision`, `prefill`, `decode`, `total`, `recovery_prepare`,
`recovery_prefill`, `kv_ram_save`, `kv_ram_load`, `kv_disk_save`, `kv_disk_load`, `kv_disk_h2d`,
and `http_tail` as full-precision JSON numbers. They need not sum to `total`: recovery re-prefill,
HIP copy time, and copy-hold wall overlap. `prepare_cpu` is `prepare` minus the media permit wait
(`media_wait`) and media acquisition (`media_fetch`). `queued` is pending-FIFO wall from Engine
submit until admission, including a requeue after a failed host restore, and excludes copy-hold.
`copy_hold` is wall blocked on victim spill or RAM/disk restore until prefill starts. `http_tail`
is the HTTP handler clock minus engine end-to-end, so it includes JSON parsing and the SSE or JSON
body built after the Engine result. `kv_ram_save` / `kv_ram_load` are
HIP event elapsed for that request's RAM-tier FIFO D2H capture and H2D unpack (Main KV, optional
MTP KV or DFlash cyclic state, and GDN images in the same copy span). They are not admission wait.
Live-lane context-checkpoint freeze D2H and a
VRAM-resident restore that unpacks already-pinned lane GDN are not included. Throughput events repeat
those two keys as interval sums. Its `speculative` object contains `backend`, `draft_window`, `rounds`,
`drafted_tokens`, `accepted_tokens`, `fallback_steps`, and `accepted_per_position`. Rates can be
derived downstream from raw token counts and seconds instead of rounded stderr strings.
When a stop cuts a licensed speculative round short, accepted-token counters include only the
committed drafts; rounds and drafted-token counters still include the work performed.

The JSONL file contains no generated response text and never records an API-key value; `argv`
replaces that value with `<redacted>`. The existing stderr summaries remain available for operators
but are rounded and are not the aggregation source. Console lines use local
`[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.mmm] [level]` timestamps. A tools-off completion whose answer contains
parseable Qwen `<tool_call>` markup also writes a `warning` line naming the ignored functions and
the request's `tools` / `tool_choice` / `tool_history` shape; the same names are in
`request_done.result.ignored_qwen_tool_call_names`. OpenAI Responses, OpenAI Chat, and
Anthropic generation requests receive a request ID when they enter synchronous preparation.
Successful preparation produces `request_start`; a preparation failure produces `request_rejected`
without a matching start. Later generation failures produce `request_error`. Schema/model
validation rejections before preparation and token-count-only calls are not measurement requests
and do not receive request IDs.

By default the server also reports aggregate activity every five seconds. `prefill` counts prompt
suffix tokens actually computed during the interval, excluding prefix-cache hits; `decode` counts
tokens finally committed by decode rounds, excluding the first token produced by prefill. For MTP
and DFlash this is the accepted committed output, not draft or rejected tokens.
`avg_decode_batch` is decode row-rounds divided by decode rounds during the same interval. The
`running`, `prefilling`, `decode_ready`, and `waiting` fields are the Engine scheduler snapshot at
the end of the interval. Fully idle zero intervals are omitted. The JSONL `throughput` event keeps
the raw token and round deltas as well as derived rates; downstream measurement should prefer those
raw values.

## Execution behavior

The server owns one resident Engine with a startup-fixed capacity of `1..8` active generation
requests. At each decode boundary, every decode-ready request is compacted into one batch and
processed by one model traversal and, when graphs are enabled, one exact-batch Device Graph replay. A
request joins that batch only after its single-request prefill finishes; when it completes or is
cancelled, the next boundary rebuilds the batch without an empty row.

`--max-pending-requests` bounds the requests waiting behind the active set. The total generation
request lifetime capacity is `max_concurrency + max_pending_requests`, including requests still in
CPU/media preparation and completed model results whose response has not yet been released. A full
capacity returns HTTP 429 with code `server_overloaded`. The absolute
`--pending-timeout-ms` deadline starts before preparation, covers media acquisition and Engine FIFO
waiting, and returns HTTP 503 with code `request_queue_timeout` if admission does not occur in time.
There is no admission ETA or unbounded overflow queue.

Input memory is bounded by the outstanding-request count and the per-request
`--max-request-mib` limit. Media requests additionally share one preparation permit, so a waiting
media request retains the same cancellation and timeout deadline. Model output is bounded by the
same finite request count and each request's effective output-token limit; output callbacks and
network serialization run outside the GPU executor and do not delay formation of the next batch.

`--max-context` and the resolved `--kv-capacity` are independent limits. The former is each
sequence's logical ceiling; the latter sizes the shared Main Text KV pool used by all active
requests and retained prefixes. Both are represented with 64-token pages internally, while a
sequence can never cross the exact `--max-context` frontier. `--kv-capacity N` requests an explicit
capacity; `--kv-capacity auto` chooses the largest legal capacity that fits the memory remaining
after weights are loaded, leaving `--kv-capacity-headroom` MiB free (default 64; raise it when a
desktop or another process shares the GPU). The token embedding is held in pinned host memory, not
VRAM. When omitted it follows
`--max-context`, preserving one full-length request's capacity. The shared pool is fixed at startup
and is not divided evenly among request lanes. `--kv-ram-capacity` is a separate pinned-host budget
in MiB for completed prefix bundles and does not change GPU pool sizing. One long MTP chat with five
context-checkpoint heads is about 6 GiB in that FIFO; `off` still keeps same-lane GDN rollback on
the live pinned log, but other-lane restore after eviction needs the FIFO.
`--kv-disk-capacity` is a third-tier SSD budget in unique object bytes. It requires
`--kv-ram-capacity > 0` and `--kv-disk-location`. Disk is inclusive of VRAM/RAM hits; equal reuse
length prefers VRAM, then RAM, then disk. `--kv-disk-compress` is not part of the directory
fingerprint and affects new GDN/hidden/cyclic writes only. When an admission's captures need RAM
and no RAM entry is on disk yet, one is spilled before it is evicted: while other requests decode,
the admission stays queued (`queued` phase, bounded by `--pending-timeout-ms`) until that spill
commits instead of dropping the entry unsaved, so a disk-bandwidth-bound load trades TTFT for
retained prefixes.
Runtime cache capacity or optional capture-allocation failures skip the capture and do not reject
generation. Optional cache-lookup allocation failure leaves normal cold admission available.
If a disk cache read or optional RAM/disk restore metadata or HIP-event allocation fails before
prefill, the Engine drains the partial restore,
excludes that entry from reuse, and recomputes the prompt from an empty KV image. The same request
returns through normal capacity admission; its original queue deadline does not expire this
already-admitted recovery. This cache fallback does not produce `service_unavailable`.
Disk format v6 fingerprints canonical logical KV pages rather than the current GPU pool capacity,
so one location can reopen across `--vision` on/off and automatic resident-capacity changes. Media
content remains part of each entry identity. The fingerprint also binds the opened artifact's
local file generation (device, inode, byte length, nanosecond modification/change times), not just
its shared model/weights names. Replaced or modified artifacts require a fresh cache directory;
even a byte-identical copy is conservatively a different file. Artifacts must remain immutable
while an Engine is using them. Pre-v6 locations fail startup: select a new directory and retain
the old one until its contents are no longer needed. KV dtype, speculative backend, and
persistent-state incompatibilities also fail startup.
On stop, orderly shutdown copies active chats into the host cache, saves cache entries that are not
yet on SSD, and finishes outstanding disk writes. The progress renderer prints `kv-disk`
`copy active chats` / `save cache entries` / `finish disk writes` counts while shutdown runs.

Automatic sizing evaluates the complete target runtime layout for the chosen concurrency, fixed
FP8-K/INT4-V growing-cache format, speculative backend, draft window, Vision setting, workspace,
and Device Graph allowance. It
uses a direct page-capacity calculation rather than allocation probing. Startup reports the policy,
resolved capacity, runtime reservation, free memory after weights, automatic headroom, planned
slack, actual free memory after complete startup, observed Graph memory, and pinned-host KV RAM
occupancy in MiB. When `--kv-ram-capacity` is enabled, a post-warmup line reprints occupancy,
periodic throughput lines print live host-resident `kv-ram=` used bytes plus `n=` / `restores=` /
`evicts=` / `drops=` / `save=` / `load=`, plus device KV page entitlement (`gpu-kv=entitled/capacity`
and `spec=` when a speculative pool exists) and non-zero `cache_fallbacks=`. Each `[req] done` line
includes `reuse_source=` and this request's non-zero `kv_ram_save=` / `kv_ram_load=` /
`kv_disk_save=` / `kv_disk_load=` / `kv_disk_h2d=` milliseconds; it does not print process
occupancy. When `--kv-disk-capacity` is enabled, throughput lines also print `kv-disk=` occupancy,
counters, and interval `h2d=`. `kv-ram=` / `n=` count chats still in the host FIFO, not chats
already consumed after a restore onto a KV lane. RAM `save=` / `load=` are HIP D2H/H2D elapsed for
that request or the throughput interval. Disk `save=` is spill-session wall harvested onto the
request; disk `load=` is the host wall from the first live SSD read of that restore until the last
page or state object has arrived in the pinned host window. Disk `h2d=` is the host wall from that
last host arrival until the restore's page and state H2D complete (extra copy time after SSD is
idle, not the overlapping first-to-last copy span). `restores=` / `evicts=` / `drops=` are lifetime
counters; lifetime capture counts stay in JSONL and on `GET /metrics`.
Exact RAM byte occupancy remains in `server_start` and `throughput` JSONL and on `GET /metrics`; set
`NINFER_KV_RAM_LOG_BYTES=1` to print those byte values on the human lines. A new capture may still
reap or evict while logged `kv-ram=` looks low. An explicit capacity is never silently reduced, and
neither policy permits request-time pool growth.

Admission reserves the full prompt-plus-effective-output page entitlement, so an admitted request
can finish within its declared bound. A later request waits in FIFO order when the remaining shared
pages cannot satisfy its complete entitlement; the Engine never admits it and later truncates an
older request to recover capacity. Startup rejects a KV pool smaller than one sequence, too small to
provide one page per configured lane, or larger than all configured lanes could use.

Compatible resident prefixes are reused for both text and multimodal histories unless the server is
started with `--no-prefix-reuse`, which also disables prefill context-checkpoint capture and the
turn-rollback pin. `--context-checkpoints off` disables only the automatic ladder; occupy-append
rollback and exact-hit `ninfer.capture_context_checkpoint` still pin when MTP/DFlash and prefix
reuse are on. A multimodal hit requires matching token types, three-axis MRoPE
positions, encoded-media digest, grid, and consumer spans; changing an earlier image or video
therefore resets the prefix instead of reusing placeholder-token KV. Media wholly inside a matched
prefix skips Vision execution, while new suffix media is encoded normally. The completion log
reports the reused token count as `cache=`. When a prefill context-checkpoint head is restored or
this request freezes one, the same line also carries `context_ckpt=restored:F` and/or
`captured:F`, the absolute head frontiers.

The shared family runtime distinguishes `full_reset`, `append_frontier`,
`restore_turn_checkpoint`, `restore_response_checkpoint`, `restore_context_checkpoint`, and
`restore_turn_rollback`. Both
rewrite checkpoint kinds include the
recurrent, hidden, and selected speculative-backend continuation state required to recompute a
rewritten suffix; matching KV tokens alone never authorize a partial hit. MTP or DFlash prefill may also
freeze current GDN at committed chunk ends that have reached a context mark (default 24576, 36864,
53248, 77824, 102400, 151552, or `--context-checkpoints a,b,c`); a later prompt that matches that prefix restores GDN into current and hidden into
`tail_hidden` as `restore_context_checkpoint`. DFlash2 also restores that lane's cyclic local K/V
and `dflash_context_frontier`. Slot `C` is the Engine-wide GDN image for that
freeze and for the turn-rollback pin: on `append_frontier` occupy with `E>0` and a
real suffix (`prompt_tokens > E`), current GDN and `tail_hidden` are copied to `C` before suffix
prefill so a later edit of the last user turn can restore that completed `E` as
`restore_turn_rollback`. The same slot is written on an exact-hit / decode-only request
(`prompt_tokens == E`) when `ninfer.capture_context_checkpoint` is true, unless a context-checkpoint
head already sits at that `E` (skip, `captured_tokens = 0`; the rollback slot stays empty until a
later `true` at a new `E`). A later exact-hit `true` replaces the one rollback pin and leaves
ladder heads. Ladder freeze borrows `C` and reloads the rollback image afterward. The rewrite
checkpoints (`restore_turn_checkpoint`, `restore_response_checkpoint`) keep their GDN and DFlash
state in lane-owned pinned host memory, about 187 MiB per lane with DFlash, rather than VRAM:
capture snapshots the lane into staging on device and drains it to the host image on the copy
stream behind later work, and restore copies staging back on device while it still holds that
image, otherwise H2D from the image before the suffix prefill.
Same last user regenerate still hits rewrite (`TurnClosure` is longer than rollback `E`). With stable
`preserve_thinking=true`, the auxiliary checkpoint rolls to the prompt frontier after the current
response's complete deterministic generation prologue. For thinking generation this includes
`<think>\n`; for non-thinking generation it includes the complete empty thinking block. Capturing
that frontier does not split a tiny trailing prologue into a separate prefill unit, and a normalized
response which no longer matches the raw generated tokens replays only that response and its
suffix. A closed turn with empty reasoning re-renders differently right after the assistant opener,
so a thinking request whose latest assistant turn carries no reasoning (the client drops it) places
the checkpoint at the generation opener instead, before `<think>\n`. That costs one short extra
prefill unit, and its next turn replays the prologue, the response and the suffix rather than
recomputing the whole prompt. A first turn keeps the prompt frontier, so a client that drops
reasoning misses once, on its second turn. A client that echoes reasoning still reuses at least the
previous prompt. Two shapes still miss on every turn: thinking off with `preserve_thinking=true` on
the Qwen3.8 template (its history omits the empty generation wrapper), and a client that keeps
reasoning inside a tool loop but strips it at the next user turn (the prompt diverges at the loop's
first assistant turn). Stable `false` keeps the first assistant opener in the open turn so a newly closed turn can
be recomputed without its reasoning.

`preserve_thinking` selects where the next checkpoint should live; it is not a cache-compatibility
bit. An exact current frontier or matching complete checkpoint remains reusable across a mode
change. If the newly desired boundary is already behind the selected reuse frontier and no snapshot
exists there, the Engine keeps the valid hit and defers installing that new checkpoint rather than
forcing an eager full reset. A later request that diverges before every retained checkpoint then
resets normally. The JSONL completion record exposes the checkpoint actually restored as
`prefix_reuse_path`, the reused length as `prefix_cache_hit_tokens`, and this request's
absolute staged-checkpoint head frontiers as `context_checkpoint.restored_tokens` /
`captured_tokens`. Changing reasoning effort
changes rendered tokens and therefore does not reuse
a prefix whose effort instruction differs.

An appended mid-conversation system message is an ordinary prompt suffix, so an unchanged prior
history remains eligible for `append_frontier`. If the client modifies, removes, or moves a
historical system message, the token prefix genuinely differs and a miss/reset is correct.

Speculative decoding is an engine option and does not change protocol output shapes, stop behavior,
or usage accounting. If a stop truncates a multi-token MTP or DFlash round, the Engine commits the
exact accepted target prefix so a following compatible turn can still reuse it. Output-limit and
context-capacity finishes map to `length`/ `max_tokens`; ordinary model or string stops map to
`stop`/ `end_turn`.

Function tools are rendered into the model prompt and generated calls are parsed into protocol
responses. NInfer does not execute tools; its supported schema subset is enforced during decoding.

Prompt-token usage includes chat-template and expanded media tokens. Generated-token usage comes
from accepted output token IDs, including a stop token whose decoded text may be withheld.
