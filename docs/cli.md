# NInfer CLI

`build-r9700/apps/ninfer` runs one request against the sole registered Qwen3.8-27B R9700
`.ninfer` artifact. Build NInfer and prepare the provisional evaluation artifact using the
[project README](../README.md) before following this guide.

## Text input

```bash
./build-r9700/apps/ninfer models/qwen3_8_27b_r9700_candidate.ninfer \
  --prompt "Summarize the difference between prefill and decode." \
  --max-context 16384 \
  --max-new 256
```

Exactly one of `--prompt` and `--messages` is required.

Answer content is streamed to stdout. Reasoning, model loading (including the registered target and
canonical `weights_id`), timings, throughput, GPU memory, and speculative-decoding statistics are
written to stderr, so stdout can be redirected independently:

```bash
./build-r9700/apps/ninfer models/qwen3_8_27b_r9700_candidate.ninfer \
  --prompt "Return one sentence." --max-new 64 \
  > answer.txt 2> run.log
```

Thinking is enabled by default. If the chat template embedded in the loaded artifact exposes
reasoning effort, `--reasoning-effort low|medium|xhigh` selects it; omitting the option uses the
template's default. An artifact whose template does not expose effort rejects the option. Add
`--no-thinking` for direct-response prompt rendering; it cannot be combined with
`--reasoning-effort`. `--greedy` selects exact argmax decoding independently.

## Startup memory profile

GPU residency is frozen when the Engine starts:

- no `--spec` omits MTP/DFlash weights and state and the optimized proposal head;
- `--spec mtp` loads only MTP; `--spec dflash` loads the Qwen3.8-27B DFlash2 companion when `dflash/` is present;
- a speculative backend with the full proposal head omits the optimized proposal head;
- Vision is disabled by default, omitting its weights, Vision scratch phase, and frozen
  request-transient allocation;
- `--vision` loads those allocations and enables image/video input.

The complete `.ninfer` inventory is still validated. These choices are not lazy loading: an
Engine without `--vision` rejects media and cannot enable Vision later. Qwen3.8-27B DFlash2 can be
combined with Vision when both are selected at startup. The
default speculative and Vision settings produce the smallest resident profile.

## Structured messages

`--messages` accepts either a non-empty JSON message array or an object containing `messages`
and an optional `tools` array.

```json
[
  {
    "role": "system",
    "content": "Answer concisely."
  },
  {
    "role": "user",
    "content": [
      {
        "type": "image",
        "image": "examples/cli/media/visual_chart.png"
      },
      {
        "type": "text",
        "text": "Describe the chart."
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

Run message files from the repository root when they contain repository-relative media paths:

```bash
./build-r9700/apps/ninfer models/qwen3_8_27b_r9700_candidate.ninfer \
  --messages examples/cli/messages/image_chart.json \
  --max-context 8192 \
  --max-new 128 \
  --vision
```

Supported roles are `system`, `developer`, `user`, `assistant`, and `tool`.
System and developer messages retain their array positions; the Qwen family frontend renders both
as system-class ChatML turns rather than moving later instructions to the beginning.

Message content may be a string or an ordered array containing:

| Content type | Source field | Accepted source |
|---|---|---|
| text | `text` | string |
| image / image_url | `image` or `image_url` | local path, HTTP(S) URL, or base64 data URI |
| video / video_url | `video` or `video_url` | local path, HTTP(S) URL, or base64 data URI |

`image_url` and `video_url` may be strings or objects containing a string `url`. Assistant
history may include `reasoning_content` and `tool_calls`; a tool result uses role `tool` and
`tool_call_id`.

Current `tools` declarations enable Engine-owned constrained tool generation. Complete,
schema-validated calls are returned separately from content; CLI prints them as a
`{"tool_calls":[...]}` JSON object after streamed text. An interrupted tool envelope is
not printed as a partial executable call. Raw output remains raw token text. The schema
subset and unsupported tool-choice modes are described in `docs/serving.md`.

See [`examples/cli/`](../examples/cli/) for committed text, image, video, mixed-media, thinking,
long-decode, and long-context inputs.

## Speculative decoding

Speculative decoding is disabled by default. MTP and DFlash2 support one to five draft positions.
DFlash2 supports Vision-composed target hidden features and target MRoPE verification positions.
`--lm-head-draft` selects the optimized proposal head and requires a selected backend:

```bash
./build-r9700/apps/ninfer models/qwen3_8_27b_r9700_candidate.ninfer \
  --prompt "Write a short explanation of speculative decoding." \
  --max-context 16384 \
  --max-new 512 \
  --spec mtp --draft-tokens 3 \
  --lm-head-draft
```

For Qwen3.8-27B DFlash2, the R9700 artifact must contain the appended `dflash/` objects. The native
runtime uses chain verification with K in 1..5; `--dflash-verify-width` must equal K+1
when explicitly supplied.

```bash
./build-r9700/apps/ninfer models/qwen3_8_27b_r9700_dflash_candidate.ninfer \
  --prompt "Write a short explanation of speculative decoding." \
  --max-context 16384 --max-new 512 \
  --spec dflash --draft-tokens 4 --lm-head-draft
```

MTP and DFlash cannot be enabled together. DFlash requires appended `dflash/` objects and
uses chain verification `W=k+1`, `k` in `1..5`. `--adaptive-draft` selects live K from `{3,4,5}`
using measured expected yield divided by round time; explicit `--draft-tokens 4` stays fixed.
R9700 speed recommendations require R9700 end-to-end measurements; NVIDIA timings do not transfer.

## Common options

| Option | Meaning | Default |
|---|---|---:|
| `--max-context N` | per-sequence logical context ceiling | `2048` |
| `--kv-capacity N\|auto` | explicit shared Main Text KV capacity, or maximize it from remaining GPU memory; omitted means `--max-context` | `2048` |
| `--kv-ram-capacity off\|N` | pinned host KV prefix-cache capacity in MiB; `off` disables the tier | `off` |
| `--kv-disk-capacity off\|N` | SSD KV prefix-cache unique-object capacity in MiB; `off` disables the tier | `off` |
| `--kv-disk-location PATH` | directory for the SSD page store; required iff `--kv-disk-capacity` is enabled | unset |
| `--kv-disk-compress off\|zstd` | zstd-1 on new GDN/hidden/cyclic writes; KV pages stay uncompressed | `off` |
| `--prefill-chunk N` | positive text-prefill chunk, in multiples of 128 | `4096` |
| `--max-new N` | requested output-token limit | `128` |
| `--device N` | HIP device index | `0` |
| `--spec mtp\|dflash` | speculative backend | off |
| `--draft-tokens N` | MTP and DFlash2 `1..5` | unset |
| `--adaptive-draft` | pick live draft K in `{3,4,5}` by locking `E[Y]/T(k,C,L)` (nested `r_i`; least-squares T; at most one probe of an unmeasured k; 1 ms switch cost). `--draft-tokens 4` stays `{4}` | off |
| `--dflash-verify-width N` | DFlash2 chain verify width `W=k+1`, `2..6` | auto |
| `--lm-head-draft` | optimized proposal head | off |
| `--vision` | enable image/video input and load Vision GPU allocations | off |
| `--no-device-graph` | disable Device Graph decode | graphs on |
| `--context-checkpoints off\|a,b,c` | disable the automatic prefill ladder, or replace the default marks (24576, 36864, 53248, 77824, 102400, 151552). Custom lists require `--spec mtp` or `--spec dflash`. Marks at or above `--max-context` stay unused. Advertised freeze `F` is the committed chunk end at or past the mark, not the raw named size. | default ladder |
| `--capture-context-checkpoint` | pin the current resume frontier `E` on an exact-hit / decode-only request (the same one-slot turn-rollback head automatic occupy-append already writes). A fresh one-shot run has `E == 0`, so this is a no-op unless a retained lane already exists in the process. | off |
| `--no-thinking` | disable thinking in prompt rendering | thinking on |
| `--reasoning-effort low\|medium\|xhigh` | select an effort exposed by the loaded chat template | template default |
| `--greedy` | exact argmax decoding | off |
| `--no-p-less-sampling` | opt out of p-less and use top-p/top-k/min-p/penalties | p-less on |
| `--temperature F` | sampling temperature override | registered model/mode default |
| `--top-p F` | nucleus-threshold override | registered model/mode default |
| `--top-k N` | top-k-threshold override | registered model/mode default |
| `--min-p F` | min-p-threshold override | registered model/mode default |
| `--presence-penalty F` | presence-penalty override | registered model/mode default |
| `--frequency-penalty F` | frequency-penalty override | registered model/mode default (`0`) |
| `--seed N` | sampling seed | `0` |

When a sampling flag is omitted, Engine selects the official general-task preset registered for
the loaded model and the rendered prompt mode. The current presets are:

| Model | Prompt mode | Temperature | Top-p | Top-k | Min-p | Presence penalty |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Qwen3.8-27B | thinking | `2.0` | `0.95` | `20` | `0` | `0` |
| Qwen3.8-27B | non-thinking | `2.0` | `0.80` | `20` | `0` | `0` |

Frequency penalty is `0` in every registered preset. Qwen's separate precise-coding recommendation
is task-specific and is therefore an explicit override rather than an inferred Engine default.

P-less is the default process/request truncation mode, with temperature `2.0` for Qwen3.8. It keeps
temperature and seed, ignores top-p, top-k, min-p, and presence/frequency penalties, and writes a
one-time warning on stderr. Ignored parameters must still satisfy their normal input ranges.
`--no-p-less-sampling` opts into the registered production sampler. Combined with `--greedy`,
p-less remains exact argmax. During thinking, p-less also exits a generated token-id
square: the least period p in [32, 2048] such that the last 2p generated ids match with
Hamming distance at most 2p/512 (so p<256 is exact identity). The continuation is excluded
from the already-computed typical set V (renormalized V without that atom, or the in-domain
runner-up when V is that singleton). This is not a `suppressed_tokens` member and does not
rebuild L. It does not detect duplicate tool calls across requests and does not alter tool-call
content. There is no CLI flag. P-less membership is `p_v ≥ max(L·exp(-2ε/T), 1/M)` with
`ε = 1/16` (first-order softmax perturbation of the logits) and `M = 1024`; L is the
unperturbed collision probability, and an empty set falls back to the eligible mode.
Under MTP or DFlash2,
p-less applies at every hop (chain Leviathan with one-hot draft `q`) and to the bonus after a full
accept. The cycle exclusion applies only to the first hop's next-token decision; later hops use
their unmodified p-less candidate sets. Temperature zero remains greedy at every hop.
The reasoning terminator (including split-token forms) and model stop tokens are never
cycle exclusions. This policy does not impose a maximum reasoning length.

With declared tools, the answer's free-text grammar excludes orphan `</invoke>`,
`</parameter>`, `</function>`, and `</tool_call>` strings outside valid call envelopes.
Actual call framing and literal XML inside schema-valid arguments remain allowed.
Reasoning excludes `<tool_call>` so a real call must follow `</think>`; ordinary reasoning
and tools-off/raw output remain allowed. This is a sampling-domain constraint,
not response-text deletion or an automatic retry.

With current declared tools, Engine separately withholds suspected duplicate-tool loops
using repeated reasoning, identical calls and unchanged associated results. It can rebuild
the internal context and retry at most twice, within the original output budget and resource
reservation. Rejected calls are not printed or executed; already printed reasoning/prose is
not retracted. Exhaustion is an explicit request error, not forced EOS or an engine shutdown.
For text-only thinking requests, persistent reasoning can also trigger an internal retry:
three non-overlapping occurrences of the same exact 256-token reasoning passage must
appear in the current generated attempt, and repeated passages must cover at least 4,096
distinct redundant tokens. Overlapping windows count those tokens only once. This is a
repetition-evidence threshold, not a 4,096-token reasoning limit. The occurrences need not
have a fixed separation,
so changing words elsewhere in a multi-paragraph loop does not hide the repeated passage.
Hashes locate candidates; exact token comparison confirms them. Two copies alone do not
trigger a retry. Long reasoning without that repetition is not limited. The failed
generated reasoning and closed historical reasoning are omitted from
the internal retry context; original user content and actual tool results are preserved,
and an explicitly labeled engine system notice asks for concrete progress. No call or
tool result is invented. Reasoning and duplicate-tool recovery share the two-retry budget.
Raw output and media inputs do not use these internal retries. See the serving reference
for the detector's conservative scope and recovery usage fields.

Repeat `--stop-token-id`, `--stop`, or `--reasoning-stop` to add stop conditions. Use
`--raw-output` to expose the frontend's raw output stream and `--print-token-ids` to include
generated token IDs in diagnostics. During structured Qwen output, registered model stop tokens
are excluded from sampling while reasoning is open and after the reasoning terminator until
non-whitespace answer content begins. This prevents a response from ending inside reasoning or
with an empty post-reasoning answer. For tools-enabled prompts, they are also excluded while a
`<tool_call>` opener is ambiguous or a tool call is incomplete, and become eligible after the
matching `</tool_call>`. A speculative round sampled with those tokens excluded commits only
through the first completing `</tool_call>`; the next round can then stop. Other caller-added stop
conditions remain active, and raw output does not apply this structured-output guard.

Run `./build-r9700/apps/ninfer --help` for the exact option contract.

## Message-input scoring

`ninfer-ppl` accepts exactly one of `--ids` or `--messages`. Message input uses the
same owning prompt adapter as generation; `--vision` enables image/video parts and
`--thinking` controls the template. Set `--max-context` for message input.
`--score-last-message` scores the final completed assistant payload, including its
reasoning and turn closure, and requires preceding history. Its boundary comes from
the actual rendered full-token sequence; an indivisible token crossing the
header/payload boundary is scored whole. It cannot be combined with `--skip`.
`--tokens` applies only to token-ID input.
For example:

```bash
./build-r9700/apps/ninfer-ppl --weights /absolute/path/to/selected.ninfer \
  --messages tests/fixtures/frontend/ppl_reply_messages.json \
  --max-context 1024 --score-last-message --out-json /tmp/reply-score.json
```

## Context and memory

The registered model has a native context limit of 262,144 tokens. The practical allocation on one
R9700 depends on the selected artifact, media workload, output budget, and enabled startup features.
Growing Text/MTP KV always uses FP8 E4M3FN keys, signed INT4 values, and FP16 value scales; there is
no runtime cache-format selector. The prepared prompt must fit
`--max-context`; generation stops at the remaining context capacity when necessary.
`--kv-capacity N` controls the shared physical Main Text KV pool independently and is rounded up to
the 64-token page size. `--kv-capacity auto` loads the selected weights, measures the remaining GPU
memory, and directly chooses the largest legal page capacity for the complete enabled runtime
layout. This includes the selected speculative backend, fixed sequence state, workspace, Vision
request transient, and Device Graph allowance, while leaving the default 1 GiB automatic headroom
unallocated. It does not probe allocations or resize the pool at request time. The single-request
CLI normally leaves the option omitted so it follows
`--max-context`; the distinction matters primarily to a concurrent Engine or server.
`--kv-ram-capacity N` is a separate pinned-host budget in MiB for completed prefix bundles. It is
not a token capacity, does not enlarge the GPU pool, and defaults to `off`. `N` must be a positive
decimal integer; `0` is rejected. Construction fails if the host pin cannot be allocated.
`--kv-disk-capacity N` is a third-tier SSD budget in MiB of unique object bytes. It requires
`--kv-ram-capacity > 0` and `--kv-disk-location PATH`. Location without capacity is an error.
`--kv-disk-compress zstd` compresses new GDN/hidden/cyclic blobs only; KV pages are never
application-compressed. Disk is inclusive: a VRAM or RAM hit does not delete the committed SSD
generation. Equal reuse prefers VRAM, then RAM, then disk.
Disk format v6 fingerprints canonical logical KV pages rather than the current GPU pool capacity,
so one location can reopen across `--vision` on/off and automatic resident-capacity changes. Media
content remains part of each entry identity. The fingerprint also binds the opened artifact's
local file generation (device, inode, byte length, nanosecond modification/change times), not just
its shared model/weights names. Replaced or modified artifacts require a fresh cache directory;
even a byte-identical copy is conservatively a different file. Artifacts must remain immutable
while an Engine is using them. Pre-v6 locations fail startup: select a new directory and retain
the old one until its contents are no longer needed. KV dtype, speculative backend, and
persistent-state incompatibilities also fail startup.
Orderly Engine shutdown copies active chats into the host cache, saves cache entries that are not
yet on SSD, and finishes outstanding disk writes. When disk is enabled, the same stderr progress
renderer prints `kv-disk` `copy active chats` / `save cache entries` / `finish disk writes`
counts as shutdown runs.
Host RAM is an exclusive FIFO: a bundle lives in VRAM or in this budget, not both. One long MTP
or DFlash bundle with five context-checkpoint heads is about 6 GiB (Main KV, optional MTP KV or
DFlash cyclic state, plus GDN checkpoint images); size the
budget accordingly. `off` still captures live-lane GDN to ordinary pinned buffers so same-lane
rollback works; other-lane restore after eviction remains a miss. Startup still
prints capacity plus `used`/`entries`. Serve `[req] done` and throughput lines print live
host-resident `kv-ram=` used bytes plus `n=` / `restores=` / `evicts=` / `drops=` / `save=` /
`load=`. When disk is enabled the same lines also print `kv-disk=` occupancy and counters. `kv-ram=` / `n=` exclude a chat after consume following a restore onto a KV lane; a later
spill recaptures it as a new FIFO tail. RAM `save=` / `load=` are HIP event elapsed for that request's
RAM-tier D2H capture and H2D unpack of the FIFO bundle (Main+backend KV, rewrite GDN, and any ladder
GDN/cyclic images in the same copy span). Disk `save=` is spill-session wall harvested onto the
request; disk `load=` is the host wall from the first live SSD read of that
restore until the last page or state object has arrived in the pinned host window (not H2D, and not a
sum of overlapped SSD and copy clocks). Disk `h2d=` is the host wall from that last host arrival until
the restore's page and state H2D complete (extra copy time after SSD is idle, not the overlapping
first-to-last copy span). They are not admission wait, and they do not include live-lane
context-checkpoint freeze D2H or a VRAM-resident restore that unpacks already-pinned lane GDN.
`restores=` / `evicts=` / `drops=` are lifetime counters on both lines.
CLI `KV RAM events` prints lifetime captures/restores/evicts/drops plus that request's `save=` /
`load=`. CLI `KV disk events` also prints `h2d=` (post-disk H2D wall). The generation summary also prints `prefix reuse path`, `prefix reuse source`, and
`context checkpoint` (`restored:F` / `captured:F` absolute ladder or turn-rollback head frontiers). Exact-hit `--capture-context-checkpoint` uses the same `captured:F` field. Exact byte values remain on the Engine API and in the JSONL request log; set
`NINFER_KV_RAM_LOG_BYTES=1` to print those same byte counts on the human lines. A new capture may
still need to reap or evict while logged occupancy looks low, because a just-consumed copy can
occupy the pin until its HIP event completes.

At Engine startup NInfer reserves model weights, persistent sequence state, one phase-reused
Program scratch arena, the maximum Vision request-transient buffer when Vision is enabled, and a
separate Device Graph driver allowance. Scratch is the maximum of the enabled Text, MTP, DFlash, and
Vision phases, not their sum. Its prefill bound uses
`min(--prefill-chunk,--max-context)`. The request-transient buffer is also frozen at startup; a
media request activates only the needed prefix and performs no project-owned device allocation or
growth.

All weight, sequence, workspace, request-transient, and graph allocations are released when the
Engine is destroyed.
