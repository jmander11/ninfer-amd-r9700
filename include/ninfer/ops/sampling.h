/**
 * Produces one token id per independent request row. `logits` is contiguous BF16
 * [physical_rows,B], `out` and `logical_positions` are contiguous I32 [B], and only vocabulary
 * rows v in [0,token_domain) participate. `configs` is a device-resident contiguous
 * SamplingConfig[B] array. Greedy and stochastic rows may coexist in one invocation.
 *
 * For row b with configs[b].temperature<=0:
 *
 *   out[b] = min argmax_v float(logits[v,b]) over v allowed by the optional
 *   eligibility bitset and not listed in the first suppressed_token_count
 *   entries of suppressed_tokens.
 *
 * Penalties, filters, RNG, and token_counts updates are skipped for that row. With positive
 * temperature and configs[b].p_less!=0, let z_v=float(logits[v,b]) over v in [0,token_domain)
 * allowed by the optional eligibility bitset and not listed in the first
 * suppressed_token_count entries of suppressed_tokens
 * (penalties, top_k, top_p, and min_p are ignored). Let p=softmax(z/temperature) over that
 * eligible domain, L=sum_v p_v^2, τ=max(L·exp(-2ε/T), 1/M) with ε=kPLessLogitPerturbation
 * and M=kPLessMaxEffectiveSupport, and V={v: p_v >= τ}. If V is empty, emit the eligible
 * mode (min argmax), or the in-domain runner-up when that mode is typical_exclude.
 * Equivalently, with e_v=exp((z_v-m)/temperature) and m the eligible
 * max logit, V is
 * {v: e_v * sum_i e_i >= max(sum_i e_i^2 · exp(-2ε/T), (sum_i e_i)^2 / M)} so the cut
 * is not rounded through L = (sum e^2)/(sum e)^2. ε slack applies only to unperturbed L;
 * the 1/M floor is not relaxed. When the floor is idle, a first-order softmax perturbation
 * of the logits cannot drop a token that exact-math p_v>=L would have kept. L is the
 * unperturbed collision probability and is not rebuilt.
 * If typical_exclude is in V and the remaining admitted mass is strictly positive, sample from
 * the renormalized restriction of p to V without that atom. If V is exactly {typical_exclude},
 * emit the in-domain runner-up (second-max eligible logit, lower id breaking ties). That atom
 * is never added to suppressed_tokens and never rebuilds L. Sample from the renormalized
 * restriction of p to V when typical_exclude is negative or outside V. With positive temperature
 * and p_less==0, let
 * c_v=configs[b].token_counts[v] (or zero when the pointer is null):
 *
 *   adjusted_v = float(logits[v,b])
 *                - configs[b].presence_penalty * (c_v > 0)
 *                - configs[b].frequency_penalty * c_v.
 *
 * Candidates are formed from the same eligible v (suppressed tokens are omitted) and sorted by
 * adjusted_v descending with lower token id breaking ties. Per-row top_k
 * in [1,19] keeps that many candidates; top_k<=0 or top_k>=20 keeps min(20,token_domain).
 * Candidate weights are exp(adjusted_v/temperature-max). min_p removes the suffix below
 * min_p*max_weight; top_p keeps the shortest remaining prefix whose cumulative weight reaches
 * top_p times the pre-truncation candidate weight. At least the best candidate remains, the
 * support is renormalized, and one id is drawn for that row. Greedy, p-less, and truncated
 * rows may coexist in one invocation.
 *
 * Row b uses counter-based RNG key
 * (configs[b].seed,logical_positions[b],purpose), without mutable RNG state or dependence on the
 * compact row index. In the positive-temperature branch the selected token atomically increments
 * configs[b].token_counts when it is non-null. Non-null token-count arrays belonging to distinct
 * active requests must not alias. `out` must not overlap logits, configs, logical_positions, or any
 * token-count array. The Op writes all of out, uses caller-owned transient storage reported by
 * sampling_workspace_capacity_bytes(), and has no other persistent-state side effect.
