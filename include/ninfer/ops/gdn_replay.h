/**
 * Op: gdn_replay_fold
 *
 * Replays each row's accepted records across every registered GDN layer and updates the
 * caller-selected absolute linear-attention state slot in place. rows[b] always maps to physical
 * record row b; rows are not filtered, compressed, or reordered. The active row count is
 * rows.size() and must be in [1,records.spec.record_capacity].
 *
 * linear_state_slot is in [0,states.spec.slot_count), is distinct across active rows, and is the
 * same absolute slot used to produce that row's records. commit_columns is in [0,T] and is the
 * linear/MTP packed prefix. Zero is a strict no-op for the row: no record or state is read and
 * neither recurrent state nor convolution history is written. path_length < 0 keeps that prefix
 * behavior: the Op consumes raw key/value/{g,beta} records in packed order [0,commit_columns) and
 * sets convolution history to tail_3(old_history || conv_record[0:commit_columns]).
 *
 * path_length == 0 is also a strict no-op. path_length > 0 replays records at
 * path[0], path[1], ..., path[path_length-1] in that time order. Each path[i] is in [0,T). The
 * convolution history is tail_3(old_history || conv_record[path[0]], ...,
 * conv_record[path[path_length-1]]).
 *
 * The Op admits the sole Qwen3.8-27B all-layer geometry (L=48, Hqk=16, Hv=48, K=V=128,
 * conv_channels=10240), owns no workspace or metadata allocation, and does not read query or
 * generate token output. The four record planes are read-only, disjoint, and do not overlap
 * either state region.
