/**
 * Op: dflash2_path_select
 *
 * Math / indexing:
 *   For each column (t,b), let rows[0..15] be the unsorted top-16 logit rows of logits[:,t,b]:
 *   the 16 largest represented logits, with lower row index winning logit ties.
 *   candidates[c] = logit_token_ids[rows[c]] when logit_token_ids is non-null, else rows[c].
 *   unary[c] = logits[rows[c], t, b]. Project the hidden state
 *
 *     h[r,t,b] = sum_{k=0}^{5119} W_h[r,k] * hidden[k,t,b],   r in [0,256).
 *
 *   prev[-1,b] = anchors[b]. Anchors are vocabulary ids (not shortlist rows). For t = 0..T-1
 *   and each candidate c,
 *
 *     score[t,b,c] = unary[c]
 *       + sum_{r=0}^{255} (pred_code[r, prev[t-1,b]] * h[r,t,b]) * succ_code[r, candidates[c]].
 *
 *   configs is a device-resident SamplingConfig[B] (same buffer the round copies into ingress).
 *   If configs[b].temperature <= 0, path[t,b] is the candidate with the greatest score; equal
 *   scores select the lower token id. If temperature > 0, the 16 scores are softmax-normalized
 *   after dividing by temperature and one candidate is drawn by inverse-CDF using
 *
 *     u = splitmix64(configs[b].seed ^ seed_xor,
 *                    logical_positions[b] + position_offset + t + 1,
 *                    purpose=16) in [0,1).
 *
 *   Then prev[t,b] = path[t,b]. Candidate order does not affect the selected token.
 *   An internal force_greedy call may override temperature for an intermediate refinement pass.
 *   When selector_ids / selector_q are non-null they receive the 16 candidate token ids and
 *   the proposal distribution q: one-hot at the greedy pick, else the 16-way softmax. Chain
 *   Leviathan accept uses this q; null selectors leave q implicit one-hot at path[t,b].
 *
 * Logical shapes:
 *   logits is contiguous BF16 [V,T] or [V,T,B] with V>=16. hidden is contiguous BF16 [5120,T] or
 *   [5120,T,B]. pred_code and succ_code are contiguous BF16 [256, codebook_rows] (rank fastest).
 *   When logit_token_ids is null, codebook_rows >= V (identity: logit row is the token id).
 *   When logit_token_ids is non-null it is contiguous I32 [V] mapping each logit row to a token
 *   id; codebook_rows >= 248320 and is not required to be >= V. Product uses codebook_rows=248320
 *   and V in {131072, 248320}. anchors and logical_positions are contiguous I32 [B], or scalars
 *   for B=1. logical_positions[b] is the current anchor position. path is contiguous I32 [T] or
 *   [T,B]. selector_ids is contiguous I32 [16,T] or [16,T,B] and
 *   selector_q is contiguous FP32 of the same shape; both null or both non-null. Every anchor
 *   and every selected token id is in [0, codebook_rows).
 *   T is any positive value at B=1; B=2..4 admits T=1..16.
 *
 * Supported domain:
 *   hidden_projection is BF16_CTRL Contiguous [256,5120], or a Linear-registered
 *   W8G32_F16S RowSplit or Q4G64_F16S Q4N16K16 problem of that logical shape. Quantized routes
 *   call ops::linear with the caller-owned workspace.
 *
 *   pred_code and succ_code are contiguous BF16 [256, codebook_rows] (rank fastest).
 *
 * Numeric:
 *   Top-k and greedy path ids are exact functions of the represented BF16 logits/scores. The
 *   score formula is evaluated by the oracle in FP64 from represented inputs and the logical FP32
 *   dequantized W_h. Stochastic draws are a function of (seeds[b], logical position, purpose); the Op does
 *   not promise a particular host RNG bitstream as a public numeric output.
 *
 * Effects:
 *   Writes all of path. When selector tensors are provided, writes all of them. Inputs are
 *   unchanged. path must not alias logits, hidden, codebooks, anchors, selector tensors, or
 *   any projection-weight plane.
 *
 * Workspace:
 *   Caller-owned transient storage sized by dflash2_path_select_workspace_capacity_bytes() holds
 *   the [256,T*B] hidden projection, per-column top-16 scratch, and any Linear child scratch.
